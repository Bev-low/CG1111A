Ryan the Colour Identifier

End of semester project for 2023/24 CG1111A


Project Description
We built a robot "Ryan" with coloour identifier capabilites.

"Ryan" has the following functions:
- Using ultrasonic and IR sensors, Ryan constantly checks if it is centered in the lane.
- Detects different colours on the ground through a self-constructed colour identifier.
- Base on the colour it reads, it executes a certian set of moves.
- When it detects white, it plays a celebratory song.
